      <h2>We are Joyce, Riyoko, Mashiyat and Iryna - 4 aspiring creative innovators hailing from all corners of the world: Joyce runs her own contemporary arts festival in Bulgaria, Riyoko is Head of Operations at a Japan/UK music charity, Mashiyat is CEO of Resurgence Bangladesh, and Iryna runs projects on municipal development in Ukraine.</h2>
      <p>The four of us met on our university degree programme, Global Markets, Local Creativities, which took us on a two-year journey through universities in Glasgow, Barcelona, Gottingen and Rotterdam. We learned about globalisation, entrepreneurship and the arts all over the world, and fell in love with Barcelona for its views, architecture and booming arts scene. So much so that we are back. </p>

      <h2>We run our businesses from all over the world, and take inspiration from our surroundings, the environment and the people.</h2>
      <p>So we decided to move to the city we loved the most - Barcelona - and buy a flat: an incredible 4 bedroom, 200 square-meter flat by the sea. And, as born entrepreneurs, naturally we began to see this as a business opportunity.</p>
      <p>Together, we are sharing its unique architecture and interior with the local creatives, initiating a broad, constructive dialogue with all critically thinking and active people around. Combining our talent and love for local arts scenes, we use our home to organise events that explore the contemporary life of the contemporary transcultural person. These include gigs, film screenings, seminars, exhibitions and workshops.</p>
